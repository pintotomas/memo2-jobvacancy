Feature: Strong passwords

  In order to have safer accounts
  As Job Vacancy owner
  I want the userâ€™s passwords to be at least 8 characters long, an upper case letter, a lower case letter and one number or symbol

  Background:
    Given I am in the registration view
    And my name is "Bob"
    And my email is "bob@test.com"
    
  Scenario: Valid password with number
    Given I fill with "Valid123" the password fields
    And I fill with "Valid123" the password confirmation fields
    When I confirm the registration
    Then My user should have been created

  Scenario: Valid password with symbol
    Given I fill with "Falafel!" the password fields
    And I fill with "Falafel!" the password confirmation fields
    When I confirm the registration
    Then My user should have been created

  Scenario: Password without an uppercase letter
    Given I fill with "invalid123" the password fields
    When I confirm the registration
    Then My user should not have been created

  Scenario: Password without a number or symbol
    Given I fill with "Invaliid" the password fields
    When I confirm the registration
    Then My user should not have been created

  Scenario: Short password
    Given I fill with "Test123" the password fields
    When I confirm the registration
    Then My user should not have been created
